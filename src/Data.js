  first:
    "As with many creative projects, the story of p-flow started with inspiration. Back in my childhood, I was exposed to handcrafts on a daily basis as my grandfather was a talented carpenter and a big inspiration for me. I used to spend days watching him working with his tools, finding great pleasure in crafting and experimenting with various materials. I brought these vivid memories all the way with me to Denmark where I started to build various objects myself.",
  second:
    "My passion for handcrafting started to manifest when I was at university. Living in a vibrant Copenhagen and getting furniture inspiration at every corner, I felt that the white dorm room, I lived back then, was missing something. So I built a clothes rack. Soon after, I designed and made a wide oak table for long dinners with friends. My desire to build things has led me to yet another creative project - clocks. I made one for my own place out of need and curiosity - I wanted to see if I would succeed in crafting it myself. With some trials and patience, each clock had become better and better, and I could not wait to share it with others. One of the first clocks I gave to my friends as a move-in to a new flat present. I knew that the flat was long wished for and I wanted to give them something special from me. (optional: That was an official start of p-flow).",
  third:
    "What I love about clock series - none of them are exactly alike. As all details are made from scratch, every clock is one of the kind. Design ideas come very spontaneously to me and I mainly use cement, oak, leather and copper to realise them.",
  fourth:
    "Hopefully, you will find here what would make your home even more special and unique.",
